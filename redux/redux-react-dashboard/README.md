# redux react dashboard 

Redux and React - Isomorphic/Universal app

## Pre-requisits
- `npm v3`
-  Make sure mongoDB is running. Instalation guide -> [MongoDB install guide](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/installation/)

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## Available Commands

1. `npm run start` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled
2. `npm run bs` - bundles the code and starts the production server
3. `npm run test` - start the test runner
4. `npm run watch:test` - start the test runner with watch mode
5. `npm run cover` - generates test coverage report
6. `npm run lint` - runs linter to check for lint errors
7. `npm check:updates` - check if there are any dependencies updates

## File Structure

### Webpack Configs

Redux React Dashboard uses Webpack for bundling modules. There are four types 
of Webpack configs provided:
- `webpack.config.dev.js` - for development
- `webpack.config.prod.js` - for production
- `webpack.config.server.js` - for bundling server in production
- `webpack.config.babel.js` - for [babel-plugin-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/istarkov/babel-plugin-webpack-loaders), for server rendering of assets included through webpack.

### Server

Redux React Dashboard uses express web framework.
The app sits in `server.js` where I check for NODE_ENV.
If NODE_ENV is development, Webpack middlewares is applied for bundling and Hot Module Replacement.

#### Server Side Rendering

Uses React Router's match function for handling all page requests so that borwser history works.
All the routes are defined in `client/routes.js`. React Router renders components according to route requested.


`match` takes two parameters, first is an object that contains routes, location and history and second is a callback function which is called when routes have been matched to a location.

If there's an error in matching we return 500 status code, if no matches are found we return 404 status code. If a match is found then, we need to create a new Redux Store instance.

**Note:** A new Redux Store has populated afresh on every request.

`fetchComponentData` is the essential function. It takes three params: first is a dispatch function of Redux store, the second is an array of components that should be rendered in current route and third is the route params. `fetchComponentData` collects all the needs (need is an array of actions that are required to be dispatched before rendering the component) of components in the current route. It returns a promise when all the required actions are dispatched. We render the page and send data to the client for client-side rendering in `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

### Client
Client directory contains all the shared components, routes, modules.

#### components
This folder contains all the common components which are used throughout the project.

#### index.js
Index.js simply does client side rendering using the data provided from `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

#### modules
Modules are the way of organising different domain-specific modules in the project. A typical module contains the following
```
| - Post
  | - __tests__ // all the tests for this module goes here
      | - components // Sub components of this module
          | - Post.spec.js
          | - PostList.spec.js
          | - PostItem.spec.js
          | - PostImage.spec.js
      | - pages
          | - PostPage.spec.js
          | - PostViewPage.spec.js
      | - PostReducer.spec.js
      | - PostActions.spec.js
  | - components // Sub components of this module
      | - Post.js
      | - PostList.js
      | - PostItem.js
      | - PostImage.js
  | - pages // React Router Pages from this module
      | - PostPage
          | - PostPage.js
          | - PostPage.css
      | - PostViewPage
          | - PostViewPage.js
          | - PostViewPage.css
  | - PostReducer.js
  | - PostActions.js
```

## Misc

### importing Assets
Assets can be kept where you want and can be imported into your js files or css files. Those fill be served by webpack in development mode and copied to the dist folder during production.

### ES6 support
We use babel to transpile code in both server and client with `stage-0` plugin. So, you can use both ES6 and experimental ES7 features.

### Docker
There are docker configurations for both development and production.

- you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.
- `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"`

To run docker for development,
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up
```

To run docker for production,
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
