# angular2-quickstart 



## Scripts

```sh
npm run start
```

1. npm start - run the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode"
The TypeScript compiler in watch mode
A static server called lite-server that loads index.html in a browser and refreshes the browser when application files change

2. npm run tsc  - run the TypeScript compiler once
3. npm run tsc:w - run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
4. npm run lite - run the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by John Papa with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
5. npm run typings - runs the typings tool
6. npm postinstall - called by npm automatically after it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.
