Things nice to know

## Meta initial scale
If you only set the width and not the scaling factor on the meta header in the IOS rendering engine,
if you switch from portrait to landscape it will keep the width and will just adjust the view to the screen size
to fit across the landscape (will think it's the portrait width)
